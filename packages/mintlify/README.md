### üöÄ Installation

Download the Mintlify CLI using the following command

```
npm i -g mintlify
```

### üë©‚Äçüíª Development

Run the following command at the root of your Mintlify application to preview changes locally.

```
mintlify dev
```

Note - `mintlify dev` requires `yarn` and it's recommended you install it as a global installation. If you don't have yarn installed already run `npm install --global yarn` in your terminal.

### Custom Ports

Mintlify uses port 3000 by default. You can use the `--port` flag to customize the port Mintlify runs on. For example, use this command to run in port 3333:

```
mintlify dev --port 3333
```

You will see an error like this if you try to run Mintlify in a port that's already taken:

```
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3000
```

#### Troubleshooting

Steps you can take if the dev CLI is not working (After each step try to run `mintlify dev` again):

- Make sure you are running in a folder with a `mint.json` file.
- Make sure you are using Node v18 or higher.
- Run `mintlify install` to re-install dependencies.
- Navigate to the `.mintlify` folder in your home directory and delete its contents.
