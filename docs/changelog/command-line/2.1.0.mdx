## Intercom Help Center Migrations

The CLI can use web scraping to automatically migrate Intercom Help Centers to Mintlify by generating MDX files. Try it out by running `mintlify scrape-section <home page url>` to scrape all pages or `mintlify scrape-page <page url>` to only scrape one page.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed hydration errors caused by code blocks.
- The "Copy" tooltip shown when hovering over a clipboard now shows up above the navigation bar instead of underneath.
- Fixed a bug where the CLI warned what `mailto:` was an invalid URL for an anchor.
