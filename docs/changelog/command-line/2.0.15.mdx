## Images in the CLI

Images stopped working in 2.0.X versions because image paths were generated wrong. 2.0.15 fixes image paths so the preview looks like production again.

## Windows Support

Our CLI uses GitHub releases to control the Minlify version bundled with the CLI. Windows computers experienced an issue with downloading Mintlify versions because of a dependency on a `head` bash command. The dependency has been removed and the CLI will work on Windows again.

## Security Improvements

Our routine security checks found one vulnerability that was not possible to exploit, but we patched it anyway to prevent future issues. The potential vulnerability was that the user could override the `PWD` environmental variable to run arbitrary shell commands in one of our code's functions. However, overriding the `PWD` environmental variable crashes the code before the vulnerable function runs.
