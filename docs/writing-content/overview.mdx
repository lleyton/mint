Components are reusable building blocks for your documentation. They can be added **directly within your files**. Some components are rendered from [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/), while other components work the same way as [React components](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html).

<Tip>
  Mintlify provides a library of [built-in components](/components) to make your
  docs beautiful without formatting things yourself.

## Examples

### Linking to Pages

You can add a link by wrapping text in `[]()`. You would write `[link to google](https://google.com)` to [link to google](https://google.com).

Links to pages in your docs need to be root-relative. Basically, you should include the entire folder path. For example, `[link to text](/writing-content/text)` links to the page "Text" in our components section.

Relative links like `[link to text](../text)` will open slower because we cannot optimize them as easily.

### Using a Component

The following example is a [Code](/writing-content/code) component, which lets you display syntax-highlighted code.

```java
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

It's rendered using the following code.

````md
```java
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
````

### Creating a callout

To present additional context outside of the main content, you can use a [Callout](/components/callouts) component.

## Components

There are a variety of components like [Accordions](/components/accordion), [Cards](/components/card), and tons others that you can explore in the [components reference](/components).
