## Getting Started

The quickstart assumes that you set up the [Starter Project](https://github.com/mintlify/starter) and completed the [Get Started](https://mintlify.com/start) form.

### Install the GitHub Bot

After completing the onboarding form, you should have received an email with the get started instructions. Install the Mintlify GitHub Bot using the link provided, making sure it's granted access to the repo with the documentation.

Now, when you make changes to the docs and push them to the main branch, it will automatically update your documentation page! It's that simple
