The `<RequestExample>` and `<ResponseExample>` to stick code blocks to the top-right of a page even as you scroll. The components work on all pages even if you don't use an API playground.

`<RequestExample>` and `<ResponseExample>` show up like regular code blocks on mobile.

## Request Example

The `<RequestExample>` component works similar to [CodeGroup](/writing-content/code#code-group), but displays the request content on the right sidebar. Thus, you can put multiple code blocks inside `<RequestExample>`.

Please set a name on every code block you put inside RequestExample.

The `<ResponseExample>` component is the same as `<RequestExample>` but will show up underneath it.
