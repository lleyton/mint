## Setting the API metadata

Setting the `api` field in the page's metadata will enable the [API playground](/api-playground/demo).

<CodeGroup>

```md Example
---
title: "Create new user"
api: "POST https://api.mintlify.com/user"
---
```

```md Format
---
title: [title of the page]
api: [method] [endpoint]
---
```

</CodeGroup>

### Method

This can be any one of the following REST API methods:

| Method   | Description                                      |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `GET`    | Retrieve information about the REST API resource |
| `POST`   | Create a REST API resource                       |
| `PUT`    | Update a REST API resource                       |
| `PATCH`  | Update a REST API resource                       |
| `DELETE` | Delete a REST API resource or related component  |

### Endpoint

The endpoint should point to the API that the playground should call. For example, it can be something like

```bash
https://api.example.com/v1/endpoint
```

<Note>

If you have `baseUrl` configured in [mint.json](/settings/global), you can use relative paths like `/v1/endpoint`.

</Note>

## OpenAPI

Mintlify also supports OpenAPI and Swagger files.
