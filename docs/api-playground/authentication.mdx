## Enabling Authentication

You can add an authentication method to your mint.json to enable it on every page or you can set it on a per-page basis.

The page's authentication method will override mint.json if both are set.

<CodeGroup>

```json mint.json
"api": {
    "auth": {
        "method": "bearer"
    }
}
```

```md page metadata
---
title: "Your page title"
authMethod: "bearer"
---
```

</CodeGroup>

## Supported Authentication Methods

- bearer
- basic
- none

The "none" authentication method is useful to disable authentication on a specific endpoint after setting a default in mint.json.

## Authentication Name

By default, basic authentication asks for username and password. However, basic authentication can use a different name for username and password. For example, you could have called it `user-id:user-key`.

You can set the name property in mint.json to override the default functionality. Use colons to separate each property you want to request.

```json Custom username and password
"api": {
    "auth": {
        "method": "basic",
        "name": "user-id:user-key"
    }
}
```

You can also request a single API key by excluding the colon.

```json Custom username and password
"api": {
    "auth": {
        "method": "key",
        "name": "my-api-key"
    }
}
```
