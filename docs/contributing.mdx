  everyone in our community to be welcoming, helpful, and respectful.

We also encourage anyone interested in contributing to check out all the

We greatly appreciate your help! ðŸ’š

## Ways to contribute

Make sure you have familiarized yourself with [Development](/development).

- Before opening a new issue, check if a similar issue or pull request already exists.
- Create a pull request with your changes and write a summary,
  as well as a test plan for the changes.
- When the PR is marked as ready for review,
  the engineering team will be notified and a contributor will handle it.

## Contribution Tools

We are using contribution tools to simplify following our standards.

<Info>
  Staged files are linted and formatted automatically on `pre-commit`.
</Info>

- [eslint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint) - Analyzes code using multiple linting configurations/rules.
- [prettier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier) - Used to format text files.
- [husky](https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky) - Used to set up and manage git hooks.
- [lint-staged](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lint-staged) - Runs eslint/prettier against staged files.
- [pre-commit](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks) - Validates and cleans up git commits
  by running the above tools automatically, using a git hook.

### Manual usage

It is possible and sometimes helpful to run the contribution tools manually.

- linting with `eslint`: `yarn lint`
- formatting with `prettier`: `yarn format`
- install git hooks (triggered automatically on `yarn install`): `yarn prepare`
- run `lint-staged` to check before committing and triggering the `pre-commit` git hook: `yarn lint-staged`

### Visual Studio Code

To format the code as you make changes you can install the [Prettier - Code formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/esbenp.prettier-vscode) extension.

<Tip>Add the following to your User Settings to run prettier on save.</Tip>

```
"editor.formatOnSave": true,
"editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
```

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues when trying to commit,
it could be because one of the tools fails to conclude successfully.

<Warning>
  `lint-staged` is using `--max-warnings 0`, which does not allow any warnings
  in staged files.
</Warning>

If warnings and errors cannot be resolved in any way,
or if refactoring old code, that includes warnings,
one of the following workarounds can be used.

- Use `--no-verify`.

```bash
git commit --no-verify
```

- Disable `eslint` rule for line/file.

```ts
// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any
const x: any = {};
```

- Fix the warning with [type assertions](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#type-assertions), [utility types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html) and [generics](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/generics.html).
- Discuss the issue or ask for help in an [issue](https://github.com/mintlify/mint/issues) or [PR](https://github.com/mintlify/mint/pulls).

<Tip>
  If you need help or if you encounter errors or warnings, don't hesitate to ask
  a question on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/MPNgtSZkgK) or
  [GitHub](https://github.com/mintlify/mint/issues).
