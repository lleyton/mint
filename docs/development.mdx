## Previewing Changes Locally

Run the following command at the root of your documentation where `mint.json` is located. Mintlify will open at `localhost:3000`.

```bash Running Mintlify
mintlify dev
```

### Custom Ports

Mintlify uses port 3000 by default. You can use the `--port` flag to customize the port Mintlify runs on. For example, use this command to run in port 3333:

```bash Running Mintlify with a custom port
mintlify dev --port 3333
```

You will see an error like this if you try to run Mintlify in a port that's already taken:

```md Example error message when port is busy
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3000
```

## Mintlify Versions

Each CLI is linked to a specific version of Mintlify. Please update the CLI if your local website looks different than production.
