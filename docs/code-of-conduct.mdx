title: "Code of Conduct"
description: "Mintlify Contributor Code of Conduct"
---

The Mintlify community aims to be a welcoming, helpful and respectful community.
To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to:

- [be friendly and patient](/code-of-conduct/#our-standards)
- [be welcoming](/code-of-conduct/#our-standards)
- [be considerate](/code-of-conduct/#our-standards)
- [be respectful](/code-of-conduct/#our-standards)
- [be careful in the words that you choose and be kind to others](/code-of-conduct/#our-standards)
- [when we disagree, try to understand why](/code-of-conduct/#our-standards)

This isn't an exhaustive list of things that you can't do. Rather, take it in
the spirit in which it's intended - a guide to make it easier to communicate
and participate in the community.

## Our Standards

- **Be friendly and patient.**

- **Be welcoming.** We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

- **Be considerate.** Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn
will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users
and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account. Remember
that we're a world-wide community, so you might not be communicating in
someone else's primary language.

- **Be respectful.** Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is
no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some
frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into
a personal attack. It's important to remember that a community where people
feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of the Mintlify
community should be respectful when dealing with other members as well as
with people outside the Mintlify community.

- **Be careful in the words that you choose and be kind to others.** Do not
insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary
behavior isn't acceptable.
In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop. Persisting in such
behavior after being asked to stop is considered harassment.

- **When we disagree, try to understand why.** Disagreements, both social and
technical, happen all the time and Mintlify is no exception. It is important that
we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that
we're different. The strength of Mintlify comes from its varied community, people
from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different
perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds
a viewpoint doesn't mean that they're wrong. Don't forget that it is human to
err and blaming each other doesn't get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping
to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.

### Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people.
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
and learning from the experience.
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
community.

### Examples of unacceptable behavior

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
any kind.
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
without their explicit permission.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
professional setting.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:

- Members of [Mintlify](https://github.com/mintlify).
- Core team members in [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/MPNgtSZkgK).

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of
actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent
ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
