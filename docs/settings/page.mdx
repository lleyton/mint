## The Basics

Each page is an MDX file that should begin with the following metadata syntax with `---` at the start and end:

<CodeGroup>

```md Schema
---
title: [title of the page]
---
```

```md Example
---
title: "Page"
---
```

</CodeGroup>

<br />

<Tip>We will use the name of the file if you forget to include a title.</Tip>

Other metadata goes in between the same `---` lines. For example, this page uses this metadata:

```md page.mdx
---
title: "Page Titles and Metadata"
description: "Metadata is important for API pages and SEO optimization"
---
```

## API Pages

API pages let you build interactive API playgrounds. To create an API page, you must set an `api` or `openapi` property in the page metadata.

Learn more about API playgrounds in [our demo](/api-playground/demo).

<CodeGroup>

```md Schema
api or openapi: [method] [endpoint]
```

```md API Example
api: "GET /users"
```

```md OpenAPI Example
openapi: "GET /users"
```

</CodeGroup>

## Descriptions

You can show a description that shows directly under the title with the `description` metadata.

```md Description Example
description: "Your description goes here."
```

## Sidebar Title

You can show a different title in the navigation with the `sidebarTitle` metadata. This is useful if your title is long and you want something shorter in the navigation links.

```md Sidebar Title Example
---
title: "Your very long page title you want to shorten"
sidebarTitle: "Short title"
---
```

## Wide Mode

You can hide the headings preview on the right side of the page. This is useful if you don't have any headings, or you want to take advantage of the extra horizontal space.

```md Wide Mode Example
---
title: "Your page with no headings"
mode: "wide"
---
```

## Search Engine Optimization

You can set meta tags like the image set when shared on social media by passing them into your page's metadata. Meta tags with colons need to be wrapped in quotes.

```md Meta Tags Example
"twitter:image": "/images/your-photo.jpg"
```

See [our SEO page](/settings/seo) for all supported meta tags.
